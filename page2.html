                        <p>Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the
                            emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi.
                            Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas.
                            In 1983, the Agra fort was life inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is about 2.5
                            km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more
                            accurately described as the walled city. Like the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort
                            prior to Mahmud Ghaznavi's invasion is unclear. However in the 15th century, the Chauhan
                            Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi (A.D.
                            1487–1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the
                            pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured
                            the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its
                            present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556–1605).</p>

                    <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [lalqila]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India
                        that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned
                        construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to
                        Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who
                        also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah
                        Jahan, and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.The fort was plundered
                        of its artwork and jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the
                        fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian
                        Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was
                        subsequently used as a garrison.
                        On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag
                        above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister
                        hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast
                        speech from its ramparts.The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as
                        part of the Red Fort Complex.</p>

                        <p>Hawa Mahal (English translation: "The Palace of Winds" or "The Palace of Breeze") is a palace
                            in Jaipur, India approximately 300 kilometers from the capital city of Delhi. Built from red
                            and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to
                            the Zenana, or women's chambers.The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap
                            Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur. He was so
                            inspired by the unique structure the of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical
                            palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five floor exterior is akin to honeycomb
                            with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The
                            original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and
                            festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the
                            strict rules of "purdah", which forbade them from appearing in public without face
                            coverings. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass
                            through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.
                            Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace,
                            but it is the back.</p>

                    <p>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai,
                        India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British
                        monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Ramchandani Road near Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Chowk
                        in Mumbai.The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Saracenic
                        style, incorporating elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the
                        monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed
                        in 1924. The structure is a triumphal arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high.
