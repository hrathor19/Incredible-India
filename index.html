                        <p>The Taj Mahal ('Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of
                            the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal
                            emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the
                            tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex,
                            which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three
                            sides by a crenellated wall.

                            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other
                            phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
                            completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million,
                            which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about U.S. $1 billion). The construction
                            project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the
                            court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.</p>

                    <p>Humayun's tomb (Hindustani or Urdu: Maqbara-i Humayun) is the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Humayun
                        in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress
                        Bega Begum (also known as Haji Begum),in 1558, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son,
                        Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian
                        subcontinent, and is located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, India, close to the Dina-panah Citadel,
                        also known as Purana Qila (Old Fort), that Humayun found in 1533. It was also the first
                        structure to use red sandstone at such a scale. The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage
                        Site in 1993, and since then has undergone extensive restoration work, which is complete.
                        Besides the main tomb enclosure of Humayun, several smaller monuments dot the pathway leading up
                        to it, from the main entrance in the West, including one that even pre-dates the main tomb
                        itself, by twenty years; it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah
                        Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals, constructed in 1547 CE.</p>

                        <p>The Qutub Minar, also spelled as Qutb Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower"
                            that forms part of the Qutb complex. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area
                            of South Delhi, India. It is one of most visited tourist spots in the city due to it being
                            one of the earliest that survives in the Indian subcontinent. It can be compared to the
                            62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c.1190, which was constructed a decade
                            or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are elaborately
                            decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is
                            fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage. In
                            general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque
                            where they exist.</p>

                    <p>The Golden Temple (also known as the Harmandir Sahib, lit'abode of God', or the Darbār Sahib,
                        'exalted court'), is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is the
                        preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism. The gurdwara is built around a man-made pool (sarovar)
                        that was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577. In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a
                        copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib. The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs
                        after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and
                        invading Afghan armies. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in
                        marble and copper in 1809, and overlaid the sanctum with Gold foil in 1830. This has led to the
                        name the Golden Temple. The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism.
                        It became a center of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba
                        movement between 1947 and 1966. In the early 1980s, the Gurdwara became a center of conflict
                        between the Indian government led by Indira Gandhi, some radical Sikh groups, and a movement led
                        by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as
                        part of Operation Blue Star, leading to deaths of over 1,000 soldiers and civilians, as well as
                        causing much damage to the Gurdwara and the destruction of Akal Takht. The Gurdwara complex was
                        rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.</p>
